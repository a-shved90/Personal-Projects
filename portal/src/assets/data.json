In fact, was there even a first time? It seems baffling that such an obvious stimulus as sound is being completely ignored and even shunned in web development world. So I thought it would be an interesting experiment to combine a favourite characters dialogue - text and audio and interactions - with web development and audio files for an immersive experience. This will give me plenty of room to experiment with audio formats, and sound integration into a website."

This coincided with my personal curiosity for my family tree and finding lost relatives - there turned out to be a whole lot of them. The best way to visualise them all, keep a record, and present all the research and work done to all of them is a tree diagram. A very familiar and widely accepted genealogy depiction tool, and with proper formatting and rich data it can be a gorgeous and impressive data showcase."
