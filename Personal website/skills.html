		<h2>Skills</h2>

		<p>I've started growing my skills portfolio back in 2009 thanks to a basic web introduction course in College. Unbeknownst to me, my career started with rudimentary tables and basic styling. I've spent countless hours experimenting with markup and styles before I got the DOM and tag relationship right. Of course it will take years before I truly think of myself as able to write damn good markup.</p>
		<p>My dabbling with javascript started shortly before I went onto my placement in Saatchi. That was a great opportunity to work with some amazing people in honing my skills and experiencing the industry. It was difficulty, but sharpened my resolve to make my way in web development world.</p>
		<p>Ever since then I was always excited to try my hand with new tools and learn as much as I can about a language that is indispensible in website development.</p>
		<p>Along the way I picked up a few handy tools like Git, which really made a huge difference when it comes to storing and sharing my work.</p>
		<p>Hereâ€™s a semi-comprehensive list of skills that I can bring with me and be proud to show off.</p>

		<section class="skills-list">

			<article class="html">
				<img src="images/html5-logo.svg" />
				<p>HTML5 quickly became the heart of my development practice ever since it first came out, I write clean semantic markup, and currently undergoing a crisis of minimalist vs OOP approach. </p>
			</article>

			<article class="css">
				<img src="images/css3-logo.svg" />
				<p>My CSS3 includes anything and everything it can get a hold of, if it can be made in CSS - it will be, in a clean, minimalistic and consistent fashion. Unless JS is more appropriate of course.</p>
			</article>

			<article class="javascript">
				<img src="images/javascript-logo.svg" />
				<p>Vanilla JS was always my longstanding dream - to write fully bespoke, optimized OOP solutions recyclable through the project. I'm slowly getting closer to my goal.</p>
			</article>

			<article class="sass">
				<img src="images/sass-logo.png" />
				<p>A fairly recent skill, but one of the most powerful - thanks to variables, mixins and nesting CSS became cleaner, smaller, more organized, and more elegant. And those sexy SASS grids...</p>
			</article>

			<article class="responsive">
				<img src="images/responsive-logo.png" />
				<p>I always make sure my websites are fully responsive and tested across multiple platforms before release. Recently switched from desktop first to mobile first approach and very happy for it.</p>
			</article>

			<article class="json">
				<img src="images/json-logo.svg" />
				<p>Learned JSON thanks to d3js library, and consider myself a strong beginner. I can do data visualization and populate DOM with whatever JSON gives, but need more practice to send it back to server.</p>
			</article>

			<article class="git">
				<img src="images/git-logo.png" />
				<p>I started off with Github but regularly relied on terminal to correct bugs and merge conflicts. Recently I moved to terminal only, but still have a lot to learn, and might move to Linux to polish my terminal skills.</p>
