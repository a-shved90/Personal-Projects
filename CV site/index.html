				<h2>Job History</h2>

				<h3>Deep Blue Sky <span>2015 - Present</span></h3>
				<h4>=== Web Developer ===</h4>
				<p class="more">Amazing place to work at, utmost attention to detail, great relationship with clients, full support from back end developers and always great care to deliver a website that everyone in the office can be proud to put their name on.</p>
				<div class="hide">
					<p>My responsibilities include a full front end package – HTML, CSS (SASS) and JS (Vanilla, Jquery, Prototype),integrating designs into a PHP based back end system called Spirit, I interact with PHP on a regular basis and while I don’t write any from scratch I frequently interact with existing scripts, copying and editing when necessary, sometimes creating entire modules from existing pieces.
					After finalizing the project brief with the client, our UX designers build a framework that Digital Designers flesh out and create a full design from, including an asset sheet and interaction patterns, and sometimes reusable blocks too. Then Front end developers take it apart and build a fully responsive, cross browser tested, interactive and animated site. At the same time PHP developers build new modules for our bespoke CMS and prepare additional functionality for the site if required, ready to be merged with front end. After Spirit and front end code is merged and turned into a fully functional site UX and UI designers go over the  whole process and make sure it flows just as intended, if not – additional revisions are added and the whole site is tweaked to be the best it can be.</p>
					<p>Versioning is done with Git and Codebase, most of which is managed through terminal, including SASS compiler and branch hierarchy.</p>
					<p>Clients include <a href="https://squashskills.com/" target="_blank">Learn from a Legend</a>, <a href="https://comparerecruit.com/" target="_blank">Comparerecruit</a>, <a href="https://amplifychange.org/" target="_blank">Amplifychange</a>.</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Freelance <span>2014 - Present</span></h3>
				<h4>=== Web Developer ===</h4>
				<p>Freelancing as a front end developer teaches me independence, responsibility, and creative problem solving. Freelancing allows me to choose tools and solutions for a problem as well as provides a perfect playing field to test out things I couldn’t otherwise do at work.</p>
				<p>During my freelancing I worked with such clients as <a href="http://shved.co.uk/Samples/Leggett/" target="_blank">Leggett Immobilier</a>, <a href="http://shved.co.uk/Samples/Smi-online/" target="_blank">SMI-online</a>, <a href="http://shved.co.uk/Samples/Malford/" target="_blank">Malford of London</a>.</p>
				<p>I also gained some experience with Squarespace, Wordpress, and plenty of legacy code.</p>
				
				<h3>CodeChange Ltd <span>2013 - 2015</span></h3>
				<h4>=== Front End Web Developer ===</h4>
				<p class="more">Management and maintenance of existing websites and completed projects. Front end development of new projects based on bespoke .NET shopping platforms</p>
				<div class="hide">
					<p>CodeChange specialized in bespoke .NET Ecommerce and Elearning platforms. After client gathering requirements they are customized in accordance with the clients needs.</p>
					<p>Then or during  this process a design was being established and passed on to front end team to be built on top of said platforms.</p>
					<p>My work involved the front end side of the process – turning a design into fully functional website, building on top of .NET functionality using partial views and master pages and linking all the functionality and generated data to the right places on design and making it interactive if needed.</p>
					<p>I was responsible for my own workload and time management, as well as negotiations with projects client during build and after submission, and passing the project on to another developer. </p>
					<p>Key technologies used were HTML, CSS and JS, focusing mainly on the first two, replacing any JS possible with CSS animations, checklist toggle nav menu would be an example. All the code was managed via Github versioning between all developers involved.</p>
					<p>JS and Jquery involved heavy use of third party plugins for sliders, slider zoom, fancyboxes, drop downs, browser caching, cookies etc.</p>
					<p>Clients included Millbrook Healthcare, AZura International, Car Care Plan, Stilwell Partnership.</p>
